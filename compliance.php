                    <h1>Compliance</h1>

                    <p>How confident are you that your company is compliant with all state and federal laws, rules and regulations?  What would the impact be to you and your company for not being compliant?  
                    Between changing legislation and health care reform, staying compliant has never been more difficult. 
                    PBS works with a team of Benefit attorneys to provide our clients with accurate and up to date information within 48 hours of a legislative change.  Below are a few of the services we provide to safeguard our customers.</p>
