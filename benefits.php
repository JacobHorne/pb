                    <h1>Benefit Statements</h1>
                    <p>Do your employees realize the significant investment your company has in them?
                    Benefit statements highlight the monetary value of your benefits package, including the perks that may be overshadowed by traditional benefits. Typical Benefit statements may include the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Salary</li>
                        <li>Bonuses</li>
                        <li>Commissions</li>
                        <li>Stock options</li>
                        <li>Stock grants</li>
                        <li>Employee stock purchase plan</li>
                        <li>Retirement plan</li>
                        <li>Social Security contributions</li>
                        <li>401(k) matching contributions</li>
                        <li>Paid time off</li>
                        <li>Coverages for health, life, dental and disability</li>
                        <li>Wellness rewards (discounts, cash bonuses, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Providing these statements increases employee awareness of how much the company spends on his or her benefits. Informing employees of the behind-the-scenes expenses that the company covers can increase retention rates and morale.</p>
